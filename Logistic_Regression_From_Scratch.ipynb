    "Logistic regression is a fundamental statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a binary dependent variable and one or more independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's primarily employed for binary classification tasks, where dependent variable takes on only two possible values, typically represented as 0 and 1."

    "### How Logistic Regression works\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike linear regression, which predicts continuous values, logistic regression employs a logistic function to transform the linear combination of independent variables into a probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "`f(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))`\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic function, also known as the `sigmoid function`, maps input values to a range between 0 and 1, representing the probability of belonging to one class (1) or the other (0). This transformation enables logistic regression to model the probability of a binary outcome rather than a continuous value.\n",
    "\n",
    "By setting a threshold value between 0 and 1, logistic regression classifies data points above the threshold as the other class(0). The choice of threshold influences the trade-off between sentivity and specificity, which respectivity represent the ability to correctly identity postive cases and avoid classifying negative cases as positive."
