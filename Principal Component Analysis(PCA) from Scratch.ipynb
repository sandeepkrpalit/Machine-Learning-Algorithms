    "## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that is widely used in machine learning. It transforms a set of correlated variables into a set of uncorrelated variables, called principal components. PCA is often used to reduce the number of features in a dataset without losing too much information. This can make machine learning algorithms more efficient and accurate."

    "### How PCA works?\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA works by finding the direction of greatest variance in the data. These directions are the principal components. The first principal component is the direction of the greatest variance, the second principal component is the direction of the second greatest variance, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Eigendecomposition\n",
    "To calculate the principal components of a dataset, PCA uses a technique called Eigendecomposition. Eigendecomposition is a mathematical technique that decomposes a matrix into its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The eigenvectors of a matrix represent the directions of greatest variance in the matrix, and the eigenvalues of a matrix represent the amount of variance in each direction."
